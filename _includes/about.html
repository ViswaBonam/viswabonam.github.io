  I am a data science and financial analytics enthusiast with a strong foundation in machine learning, predictive modeling, and data visualization. Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s in Financial Technology and Analytics at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I’m developing specialized skills in data-driven financial analysis and advanced statistical techniques.
  I love working with great people, getting creative with data, using state-of-the-art technologies and building awesome products.

      I'm strongly convinced that machine learning models should not go to waste in Jupyter Notebooks.
      Using my software engineering skills, I've built and deployed AI services which create real business value.

      Communicating a data project effectively is essential to convey insights and drive decision-making. 
      A strong presentation should include the project’s objective, methodology, key findings, and actionable outcomes.
